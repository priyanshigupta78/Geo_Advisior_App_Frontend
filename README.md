# GEO ADVISOR
GEO ADVISOR is a web app in which we will be able to find the places according to the reviews.Using authentication in this web app for accessing it.
There will be two options for the Tourists.
Firstly, they will come to find the place around them
Secondly,
 Geo Location is the identification or estimation of the real-world geographic location of an object, such as any hotel,  restaurant , local  shops etc.. In its  simplest form geolocation involves the local street shops and is closely related to the use of a positioning system,  but its usefulness is enhanced by the use of these coordinates to determine a meaningful location, such as a street address.

Every place on earth can be identified by two simple numbers: the longitude and latitude.
Longitude is a geographic coordinate  that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface. It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in degrees.
Latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north south position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator.

# TECHNOLOGY USED
- React js
- Node js

- MongoDB
- MapBox, React Mapbox-gl


### REACT-JS:-
React.js/React is an open-source frontend framework that is based on JavaScript. It is one of the most popular Javascript libraries and is primarily used for creating frontend user interfaces.

### EXPRESS-JS :-
Express, is a back end web application framework for Node. js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.

### MONGODB :-
MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data.

### MAPBOX :-
Mapbox is a mapping and location cloud platform for developers — we don't have an app, we're the building blocks; the SDKs and APIs for developers and designers to build real time location awareness into their own apps.
